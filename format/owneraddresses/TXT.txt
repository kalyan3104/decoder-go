Let's break down each component of this block in detail:

1. Timestamp (Timestamp: 1740409056)
Value: 1740409056
Meaning: This is a Unix timestamp (also called epoch time).
Definition: The number of seconds since January 1, 1970 (UTC).
Purpose: Helps record when the block was created.
Example Conversion:
If 1740409056 is converted to human-readable time, it corresponds to Friday, June 27, 2025, at 12:57:36 UTC.
2. Data (Data: Block 3: User E sent 2 SOL to User F)
Value: "Block 3: User E sent 2 SOL to User F"
Meaning: This is the transaction information stored in the block.
Purpose: It records the actual data that is being stored on the blockchain.
Example: Here, User E is sending 2 SOL (Solana tokens) to User F.
3. Previous Hash (Previous Hash: 69c748bee275f4df6202ab16e2513cba13d6c144bf8ecde1b6b40370c2154f6f)
Value: "69c748bee275f4df6202ab16e2513cba13d6c144bf8ecde1b6b40370c2154f6f"
Meaning: This is the hash of the previous block in the blockchain.
Purpose: It links this block to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks.
Security: If someone tries to modify an older block, it will change its hash, breaking the chain.
4. Hash (Hash: 098fea14b875433d223d0db3fa02e5a9761758427f4ff865e52354f9ac902a53)
Value: "098fea14b875433d223d0db3fa02e5a9761758427f4ff865e52354f9ac902a53"
Meaning: This is the unique SHA-256 hash of the current block.
How it's generated:
ini
CopyEdit
Hash = SHA-256(index + timestamp + data + previous_hash)
Purpose:
Ensures integrity (any change in block data will result in a different hash).
Helps secure the blockchain by making tampering difficult.
Example: If someone tries to change the transaction data, this hash will change, causing a mismatch with the next blockâ€™s previous_hash.
Summary
Field	Value (Example)	Purpose
Timestamp	1740409056	Shows when the block was created
Data	"User E sent 2 SOL to User F"	Stores transaction details
Previous Hash	69c748bee275...f6f	Connects to the previous block
Hash	098fea14b875...a53	Unique fingerprint of this block
This structure ensures that each block is linked to the previous one, forming a secure and immutable blockchain. ðŸš€

This Rust program implements a simple blockchain with basic functionalities like block creation and chaining. Let's go through it line by line.

Imports

std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH}: Provides the ability to get the current timestamp in seconds since UNIX_EPOCH (January 1, 1970).
sha2::{Digest, Sha256}: Imports the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to generate cryptographic hashes.
Block Structure
rust
CopyEdit
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Block {
    index: u64,
    timestamp: u64,
    data: String,
    previous_hash: String,
    hash: String,
}
#[derive(Debug)]: Automatically enables debug printing for the Block struct.
struct Block: Defines a block in the blockchain.
index: u64: A unique identifier (block number).
timestamp: u64: The time when the block was created.
data: String: Stores transaction details.
previous_hash: String: Hash of the previous block (ensures immutability).
hash: String: The unique SHA-256 hash of the current block.
Block Implementation
rust
CopyEdit
impl Block {
    fn new(index: u64, data: String, previous_hash: String) -> Self {
        let timestamp = SystemTime::now()
            .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
            .unwrap()
            .as_secs();

        let hash = Self::calculate_hash(index, timestamp, &data, &previous_hash);

        Block {
            index,
            timestamp,
            data,
            previous_hash,
            hash,
        }
    }
fn new(index, data, previous_hash) -> Self: A constructor for Block.
timestamp: Gets the current Unix timestamp.
Calls calculate_hash to generate the block's hash.
Returns a new Block instance.
Hash Calculation
rust
CopyEdit
    fn calculate_hash(index: u64, timestamp: u64, data: &str, previous_hash: &str) -> String {
        let input = format!("{}{}{}{}", index, timestamp, data, previous_hash);
        let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
        hasher.update(input.as_bytes());
        format!("{:x}", hasher.finalize())
    }
}
calculate_hash: Computes a SHA-256 hash for a block.
Combines the block's index, timestamp, data, and previous_hash into a string.
Hashes the string using SHA-256 and converts it into a hexadecimal string.
Blockchain Structure
rust
CopyEdit
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Blockchain {
    blocks: Vec<Block>,
}
struct Blockchain: Represents the blockchain.
blocks: Vec<Block>: A vector (Vec) that holds a sequence of Blocks.
Blockchain Implementation
Creating a Blockchain
rust
CopyEdit
impl Blockchain {
    fn new() -> Self {
        let genesis_block = Block::new(0, "Genesis Block".to_string(), "0".to_string());
        Blockchain {
            blocks: vec![genesis_block],
        }
    }
fn new() -> Self: Creates a new blockchain.
Genesis Block: The first block, with:
index = 0
data = "Genesis Block"
previous_hash = "0" (since no previous block exists).
Stores the genesis_block in the blockchain.
Adding a New Block
rust
CopyEdit
    fn add_block(&mut self, data: String) {
        let previous_block = self.blocks.last().unwrap();
        let new_block = Block::new(
            previous_block.index + 1,
            data,
            previous_block.hash.clone(),
        );
        self.blocks.push(new_block);
    }
}
fn add_block(&mut self, data: String): Adds a new block.
Gets the previous block (self.blocks.last()).
Calls Block::new() with:
index = previous_block.index + 1
previous_hash = previous_block.hash
Pushes the new block to self.blocks.
Main Function
rust
CopyEdit
fn main() {
    let mut blockchain = Blockchain::new();
let mut blockchain = Blockchain::new();: Creates a new blockchain with the genesis block.
Adding Blocks
rust
CopyEdit
    blockchain.add_block("Block 1: User A sent 5 SOL to User B".to_string());
    blockchain.add_block("Block 2: User C sent 3 SOL to User D".to_string());
    blockchain.add_block("Block 3: User E sent 2 SOL to User F".to_string());
Calls add_block() with transaction details.
Printing the Blockchain
rust
CopyEdit
    for block in &blockchain.blocks {
        println!("Block #{}", block.index);
        println!("Timestamp: {}", block.timestamp);
        println!("Data: {}", block.data);
        println!("Previous Hash: {}", block.previous_hash);
        println!("Hash: {}", block.hash);
        println!("-----------------------------");
    }
}
Loops through all blocks and prints:
Block #index
Timestamp
Data
Previous Hash
Hash
Final Output Example
mathematica
CopyEdit
Block #0
Timestamp: 1708692345
Data: Genesis Block
Previous Hash: 0
Hash: 6b7c4b78b8c... (SHA-256 hash)
-----------------------------
Block #1
Timestamp: 1708692350
Data: Block 1: User A sent 5 SOL to User B
Previous Hash: 6b7c4b78b8c...
Hash: c5a9d4f213f...
-----------------------------
Block #2
Timestamp: 1708692352
Data: Block 2: User C sent 3 SOL to User D
Previous Hash: c5a9d4f213f...
Hash: e3b1a1b5c9e...
-----------------------------
Each block links to the previous block using its hash.

Key Takeaways
Blocks store transactions and link to the previous block.
SHA-256 hashing ensures immutability.
The blockchain starts with a Genesis Block.
New blocks reference the previous block's hash, forming a chain.
This is a basic blockchain implementation but lacks features like proof-of-work, consensus mechanisms, and decentralization (which real blockchains like Bitcoin have).
